Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide, causing a substantial number of deaths. Early detection and prediction of heart disease can greatly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using artificial neural networks (ANN) based on data from various sources.


 Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate predictive model for heart disease using artificial neural networks. Specifically, the project aims to:
Utilise a dataset containing relevant features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators.
Train and evaluate an ANN model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients.
Provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in assessing a patient's risk of heart disease based on their medical data.
